    <h1>404 :(</h1>
    <p>This was a really bad request, Please wait a while, and try again.</p>
    <h2>More Details</h2>
    <p>Idk man, something went wrong. Now, theres two options you can do. Number one is to return to the home
    page through the breadcrumb navigation, and this is the suggested option. Number two is to wait a while and try
    again. Perhaps the web page hasn't finished loading yet.</p>
    <p>If this issue still persists, launch an issue at our <a href="https://github.com/Skrillx13/stardustcircuits/issues">GitHub</a>. Thanks!</p>
